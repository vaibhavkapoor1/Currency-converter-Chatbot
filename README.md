Currency converter chatbot using DialogFlow.

Intent and entities created using DialogFlow.

Used webhooks and tunneling using ngrok to integrate the chatbot with our offline script.

To run it on your PC, clone this repository and install ngrok.

Run the command- ngork http 5000

Used this API for fetching the conversion rates - app.exchangerate-api.com

An app was created using Flask for the backend code.

The app is not deployed instead tunneled through ngrok for optimized development.

ngrok is a cross-platform application that enables developers to expose a local development server to the Internet with minimal effort. The software makes your locally-hosted web server appear to be hosted on a subdomain of ngrok.com, meaning that no public IP or domain name on the local machine is needed.
